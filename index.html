        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was a Bengali poet, writer, and philosopher who is widely regarded as one of the most important cultural figures in modern Indian history. He was the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1913, and is best known for his poetry and songs, which are still popular in India and Bangladesh today. Tagore was also a social reformer and political activist, advocating for Indian independence from British colonial rule. He founded a school called Shantiniketan, which later became Visva-Bharati University, and he was also involved in various other cultural and educational initiatives throughout his life. His works have been translated into many languages and continue to inspire people around the world. Rabindranath Tagore's writing is deeply rooted in both Indian and Western learning traditions. Apart from fiction in the form of poetry, songs, stories, and dramas, it also includes portrayals of common people's lives, literary criticism, philosophy, and social issues. Tagore originally wrote in Bengali, but later reached a broad audience in the West after recasting his poetry in English. In contrast to the frenzied life in the West, his poetry was felt to convey the peace of the soul in harmony with nature.</p>
